A python script for finding the words in a word find excercise.

Instructions:
    1. Create a new text file in the same directory as the script
    2. Type in the board from the word finder, with a space between each letter and no extra spaces on the end
    3. Run the script, and enter the words you want found
    4. The script will create a new text file called 'Final_Output.txt'. This will contain the solutions in uppercase

NOTE: Still figuring out the commit system on git, that's why most of the commit messages don't make sense.
